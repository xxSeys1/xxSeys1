Hi :)
## About me
I'm a student from Germany who's interested in software- and gamedev.

I like doing video editing & making videos (check out my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@S4AAS) btw), 3d modeling and programing.
Also occasionally I do other non technical stuff like listening to German HipHop.
## Some of the software I use:
- VScode / VS
- [Flax Engine](https://github.com/FlaxEngine/FlaxEngine/)
- Unreal Engine
- DaVinci Resolve
- Blender
- Affinity Photo & Designer (free for 6 months btw ðŸ‘€)
- Notion
## What languages do I speak?
- German
- English
- One of my french teachers once said that my french wasn't too bad but I think they were lying...
